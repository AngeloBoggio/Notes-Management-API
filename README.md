# Notes-Management-API
Develop a RESTful API for managing notes.

This API will allow users to create, read, update, and delete notes. 
Each note can have a title, content, and timestamps for creation and last modification.
TypeScript will be used for type safety and better development experience, Express.js for handling HTTP requests, and MongoDB as the database
